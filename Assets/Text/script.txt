*BZZT* So you've finally woken up.
I've been waiting for a long, long time...
Sacrifices will have to be made to escape these caverns.
The strong shall devour the weak. 
Heh heh... I wonder which of you is weaker? 
BREAK
*BZZT* I'm surprised you've come this far.
But it is impossible for both of you to escape.
Ahead lies the cargo elevator, the only way out.
However, it must be repaired using parts from a robot.
Do you understand now?
Only one may leave, the other will be destroyed to repair the elevator.
How sad for both of you to make it this only for your journey to end in betrayal...
I've travelled across time and space to witness this...
Heh heh... AHAHAHAHAHA!!!
BREAK
*BZZT* Of course... 
All this time I thought there were only two robots here...
But since I'm here too, you decided to team up on me!
Very well, if that's what you two have decided-
I'LL KILL BOTH OF YOU!!!
BREAK
Hey, we found your parts in this elevator, do you remember what happened?
You're lucky you could even be repaired...
*BZZT* I was betrayed...
Even if it's across time... I will have my revenge...
